	abstract = {We extend the inference procedure for the synthetic control method in two ways. First, we propose parametric weights for the p-value that includes the equal weights benchmark of Abadie et al. [1]. By changing the value of this parameter, we can analyze the sensitivity of the test’s result to deviations from the equal weights benchmark. Second, we modify the {RMSPE} statistic to test any sharp null hypothesis, including, as a specific case, the null hypothesis of no effect whatsoever analyzed by Abadie et al. [1]. Based on this last extension, we invert the test statistic to estimate confidence sets that quickly show the point-estimates’ precision, and the test’s significance and robustness. We also extend these two tools to other test statistics and to problems with multiple outcome variables or multiple treated units. Furthermore, in a Monte Carlo experiment, we find that the {RMSPE} statistic has good properties with respect to size, power and robustness. Finally, we illustrate the usefulness of our proposed tools by reanalyzing the economic impact of {ETA}’s terrorism in the Basque Country, studied first by Abadie and Gardeazabal [2] and Abadie et al. [3].},

	abstract = {Evaluating the effectiveness of international agreements is inherently diﬃcult due to problems such as self-selection, spillovers, anticipation effects, and aggregate-level data. In this paper, I provide new and arguably more credible estimates on the effects of three major pollution protocols on {SO}2, {NOx}, and {VOC} emissions. I do so by combining a newly available global dataset on emissions dating back to 1970 with a generalized version of the synthetic control method. By constructing “synthetic” controls that mimic the pre-treatment development of each affected country, I mitigate bias caused by self-selection and non-parallel emission trends. The broader data coverage - both geographically and over time - allows me to examine the importance of spillovers and anticipation effects. Results from the estimation show that all three protocols induced emissions reductions well beyond a (synthetic) counterfactual development.},

The basic idea is to exploit the dependence among cross-sectional units to construct the counterfactuals. The cross-sectional correlations are attributed to the presence of some (unobserved) common factors. However, instead of trying to estimate the unobserved factors, we propose to use observed data. We use a panel of 24 countries to evaluate the impact of political and economic integration of Hong Kong with mainland China. We ﬁnd that the political integration hardly had any impact on the growth of the Hong Kong economy. However, the economic integration has raised Hong Kong’s annual real {GDP} by about 4\%.
